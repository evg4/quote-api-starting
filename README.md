## Title
Quote API
## Description 
I built this as part of the Codecademy Full Stack Engineer path. There was already a simple UI and some boilerplate code. I added API requests in the server.js file to fetch, update, add and delete quotes. I also added a new page to the UI to allow for existing quotes to be updated. I used postman to test the DELETE route.
## How to use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/evg4/quote-api-starting.git
   cd quote-api-starting
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

4. Open a browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:4001
   ```
